* Change the format: In your document's YAML header, change `format: html` to `format: revealjs`.
* Add slides: Use first-level headings (`#`) to create a new slide. Use other Markdown headings and text for content on each slide.
* Render: Save and render your document. Quarto will create an HTML file that is a fully functional slide deck.

Note: You can remove code-fold and code-summary from the YAML header, as these are for HTML documents and do not apply to presentations.
