* In your document's YAML header, change `format: html` to `format: revealjs`.
* Use first-level headings (`#`) to create a new slide. Use other Markdown headings and text for content on each slide.
* Save and render your document. 

Quarto will create an HTML file that is a fully functional slide deck.

You can remove `code-fold` and `code-summary` from the YAML header, as these are for HTML documents and do not apply to presentations.
