Create a brand file for your organization using the Brand Extension.

  * Open your Terminal and run: `quarto create extension brand`
  * Read about how to prompt a large language model (LLM) to create a _brand.yml file: [posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/articles/llm-brand-yml-prompt](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/articles/llm-brand-yml-prompt)
  * Customize the default `_extensions/mybrand/brand.yml` file. Take note of how well the output incorporates your brand and what, if any, elements are missing or need to be adjusted.
    * Preview by running `quarto preview example.qmd` in the Terminal.
