### R

1. In the first code chunk of `01-exercise-r.qmd`, replace  `theme_minimal()` with `theme_brand_ggplot2()`. You will need to supply a brand file path (`"_brand.yml"`).  

1. Re-render and see what changes. 

### Python

1. In the first code chunk of `01-exercise-python.qmd`, add `theme_brand_plotnine()` right before `theme_minimal()`. You will need to supply a brand file path (`"_brand.yml"`). 

1. Re-render. Does anything change? What if you change `foreground` in `_brand.yml` to `hot-pink`? Re-render with and without `theme_brand_plotnine()`.
