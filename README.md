## Description

Join us for a hands-on, one-day workshop at posit::conf(2025), where we’ll explore the versatility of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) output formats. Designed for data scientists, analysts, and content creators, this immersive session will teach you how to craft cohesive reports and presentations while refining your workflow with Quarto’s latest features.

You will learn how to create dynamic websites, professional PDF documents, engaging presentations, and interactive dashboards using Quarto. This workshop highlights Quarto's powerful theming capabilities, including the new support for brand.yml, which ensures that your work maintains a professional and cohesive style across all formats.

By the end of the session, you’ll be equipped to:

* Build and deploy Quarto websites.
* Generate professional presentations and PDF reports.
* Create interactive dashboards for data visualization and reporting.
* Use brand.yml to define and apply consistent theming across all outputs.

Whether you're looking to enhance your personal projects or streamline organizational outputs, this workshop will equip you with the tools to create polished, professional results.

## What to bring

- A charged laptop: This is a must for participating in the exercises.
- Your preferred IDE and programming language: We'll be working in RStudio, VS Code, or Positron in either R or Python. We will also provide cloud options on Posit Cloud and GitHub Codespaces if you prefer not to work locally.
- Quarto v1.8: Please download and install the latest version from https://quarto.org/docs/download.
- Bring your own brand (BYOB): Bring a style guide, branding fonts, colors, or an example project. We'll have time to replicate your or your organization's style in the documents we create.
