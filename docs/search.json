Let‚Äôs break this down: Open-source: Posit believes that it‚Äôs better for everyone if the tools used for research and science are free and open. Free software means more reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and elimination of cost barriers. Scientific and technical: Scientific and technical means that Quarto has specific things for journal articles or scientific papers, like support for code execution, citations, footnotes, scientific markdown, equations, citations, crossrefs, so many things. Publishing system: Quarto is a tool for writing dynamic documents that combine code, output, and text. It can embed output from Python, R, Julia, and Observable. Quarto can be rendered to create high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more formats. Pandoc is the tool working behind the scenes to change Quarto documents to their finalized format. Quarto documents are authored with markdown, which is a plain text format. But Pandoc markdown is very rich and lets you control your document in very specific ways while being easy to read and write."

Like mentioned earlier, Quarto was built from the start to support multiple computational systems and ecosystems. You can create presentations, books, websites, and so on after installing Quarto, you do not have to install other tools to create different things. Consistent expression for core features means that regardless of whether you are making a presentation, book, or website, the syntax is written same way. And for things that aren‚Äôt part of base Quarto, there are extensions that can add further functionality. Single-source publishing, you often need to create all sorts of output, like things that are printed, on the web, on the mobile. The idea is to being able to make publications from one source. And the Quarto team thinks deeply about accessibility and how to have Quarto default to meet accessibility guidelines."

    "text": "Automate and reproduce your output\nDuplicating Quarto elements with code templates to reduce copy and paste errors by Althea A. Archer (United States Geological Survey)\n\n\nWith Quarto, you can create reports or presentations that update automatically when data changes or when you change inputs because you are creating your report with code. There‚Äôs a software engineering concept called the DRY Principle (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Repeat Yourself‚Äù) that is useful in data work that encourages writing code that can be reused with functions or loops instead of copy/paste. Use variables (parameters) to dynamically change parts of your analysis or report like to generate the same report for different regions, departments, or time periods, write reusable functions to avoid repeating code and keeps work cleaner, more consistent, and easier to maintain. The folks at United States Geological Survey have great blog posts on how they are implementing these ideas in Quarto."

Finally, you can always install Positron, RStudio, or VS Code locally, but you will also need R or Python installed. You‚Äôll also have to install the packages and download the repo materials. And for VS Code, you‚Äôll need to install the Quarto extension. So, if you do not have these set up, I recommend going with Posit Cloud or GitHub Codespace for now, and coming back to the materials after the workshop."
